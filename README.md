# Bevvie 

This project's name is **Bevvie**, a mobile application developed using Swift that serves as a platform to track, analyze, and recollect all your favorite beverages, also known as a bevvie! Bevvie allows users to log in, record the name, location, price, and type of bevvie they purchased that day, inputting it into their own personal database record of lifetime bevvies. 

Other features include an achievements section to commemorate milestones, a calendar to mark days of the month when a bevvie was purchased, and an analytics page to track trends in your bevvie journey.
